## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/je-jo/edie-homepage/main/edie-homepage.png)

I've tried BEM naming but it was quite challenging to identify common elements in this page, there are many variations. In order to cut down on number of classes, some elements are not exactly following the design.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- [Minireset](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/jgthms/minireset.css?categoryPage=29) - A tiny modern CSS reset.
